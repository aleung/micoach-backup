miCoach Backup
=====

**miCoach backup** is a tool to save your workouts from [Adidas miCoach] to your computer.

Description
----

**miCoach backup** contains two things:

  - the beginning of a Python implementation of *Adidas miCoach* API 
  - a small GUI for selecting and saving you workouts

This was forked from Manual Vonthron's micoach-backup.  I ported it to python 3 and removed the use Mariano Reingar's SimpleXML library in favor of lxml.  I added writeGpx and a working version of writeTcx for export options.  The PySide based GUI has been removed for my own crude Gtk+ 3 GUI. The "xml" backup option will save the raw xml file that is delivered from the [Adidas miCoach] website.


Usage 
-----
